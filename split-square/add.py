"""Produce new square adding two inputs squares.

Two simple squares can be added::

    >>> s1 = 0
    >>> s2 = 1

    >>> add(s1, s2)
    1

A simple square and a split square can be added::

    >>> s1 = 0
    >>> s2 = [1, 0, 1, 0]

    >>> add(s1, s2)
    [1, 0, 1, 0]

Two split squares can be added::

    >>> s1 = [0, 0, 0, 1]
    >>> s2 = [0, 1, 0, 1]

    >>> add(s1, s2)
    [0, 1, 0, 1]

Nested squares can be added::

    >>> s1 = [0, [1, 1, 1, [0, 0, 0, 0]], [0, 0, 0, 0], 1]
    >>> s2 = [1, [1, 0, 1, [0, 0, 1, 1]], [1, 0, 1, 0], 1]

    >>> add(s1, s2)
    [1, [1, 1, 1, [0, 0, 1, 1]], [1, 0, 1, 0], 1]

Unevenly-nested squares can be added::

    >>> s1 = [0, [1, 1, 1, 0           ], [0, 0, 0, 0], 1]
    >>> s2 = [1, [1, 0, 1, [0, 0, 1, 1]], [1, 0, 1, 0], 1]

    >>> add(s1, s2)
    [1, [1, 1, 1, [0, 0, 1, 1]], [1, 0, 1, 0], 1]

    >>> s1 = [0, [1, 1, 1, 1                      ], [0, 0, 0, 0], 1]
    >>> s2 = [1, [1, 0, 1, [0, [0, 0, 0, 0], 1, 1]], [1, 0, 1, 0], 1]

    >>> add(s1, s2)
    [1, [1, 1, 1, [1, [1, 1, 1, 1], 1, 1]], [1, 0, 1, 0], 1]
